Spare Closet is an Instagram Shop that I plan to launch in the near future. The business will run via Instagram, so I created a simple website that allows users to view the site and have easy access to. 

Using Instagrams Developer Tools, I pulled in the API and run the script on my page with my accoun ID and client access token.  This allows my Instagram feed to populate the "New Items" portion of the homepage. When a user clicks a photo, they will be directed to the Instagram Shop where they can chose to purchase the item.

View the website by running index.html. This site is also hosted on GitHub Pages at https://kimicross.github.io/spare-closet/
