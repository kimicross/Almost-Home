<h1>Spare Closet</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
Spare Closet is an Instagram shop that will sell new and gently worn womens clothing.

<b>Background:</b> A lot of Instagram shops have rules, feedback, and other vital information posted as a picture. As an end-user, I find it frustrating to navigate through the shops' feed to find out important information because every shop has different policies and rules.

<b>Opportunity:</b> I saw an opportunity to build a website that would be a convenient and easy way for users to access pertinent information as well as shop directly from the website. 

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>View the website by running index.html. This site is also hosted on GitHub Pages at https://kimicross.github.io/spare-closet/</p>
<ul>Active Links:
  <li>Home (Spare Closet logo)</li>
  <li>How it works</li>
</ul>

<p>This site is built with a custom Bootstrap framework and is responsive on many devices.</p>
<p>This site also uses Instagram's API to pull in Spare Closet's Instagram feed on the homepage. I applied for Instagram Developer Tools to access my client token and run the script on my page with my accoun ID. I've coded the script to populate the homepage in real-time with "New Items" whenever they are posted on Instagram. When a user clicks a photo from Spare Closet's website, they will be directed to the Instagram Shop where they can chose to purchase the item.</p>
